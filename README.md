Negroku
=======

Negroku is an opinionated collection of recipes for capistrano.

The goal is to be able to deploy **ruby on rails applications** and **static websites** without the hassle of configure and define all the stuff involved in an application deployment.

All the server configurations pre-defined in the configuration files generated by negroku are targeted oto this generic [configuration guide](https://github.com/platanus/guides/tree/master/deployment).

Installation
------------

Just install negroku as a global gem.

    gem install negroku

## Getting started

1. Bootpstrapp your app (behind the scene it runs `capify .` plus some customizations)

    It will add this files to your proyect, this is the same structure that capistrano expect when using multistage extensions

    ```
    project_root
     |--- Capfile                       # Capistrano load file
     +--- config
           |--- deploy.rb               # Global setting for all environments
           +--- deploy
                 |--- production.rb     # Specific settings for production server
                 +--- staging.rb        # Specific settings for staging server
    ```

    It will also add to your Gemfile two gems

    ```ruby
    group :assets do
        gem 'therubyracer', :platforms => :ruby
    end

    group :production do
        gem 'unicron'
    end
    ```

1. Configure your specific settings in the files created above

1. Prepare your server for your application with `cap deploy:setup` task

1. Deploy you application with `cap deploy` task
